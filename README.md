Account Executive, Airbnb for Business
Airbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

Business travel is making a strong comeback, and current industry trends are playing to Airbnb’s strengths. Stays are getting longer, alternative accommodations are gaining market share, and travelers are increasingly self-sufficient.
