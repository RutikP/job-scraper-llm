# Job Scraper LLM Project 

## Overview
The **Job Scraper LLM Project** is an AI-powered application that scrapes job listings from online sources and uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to analyze, structure, and match job descriptions with candidate skills.

This project demonstrates **LLM integration, modular Python architecture, and real-world automation use cases**.
